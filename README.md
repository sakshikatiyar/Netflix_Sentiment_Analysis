# 📺 Netflix Sentiment Analysis using Neural Networks  

## 📌 Overview  
This project applies **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Neural Networks** to perform sentiment analysis on Netflix reviews.  
The model classifies user reviews into **positive, negative, or neutral** sentiments, helping understand audience opinions and improving recommendation systems.  

---

## 📂 Dataset  
- Contains Netflix reviews with text and labeled sentiment.  
- Preprocessing steps include:  
  - Tokenization & text cleaning  
  - Stopword removal  
  - Sequence padding for uniform length  
  - Label encoding (Positive, Negative, Neutral)  

---

## 🧠 Model Architecture  
The model is implemented using **Keras & TensorFlow** with the following layers:  

- **Embedding Layer** → Converts words into dense vector representations  
- **LSTM Layer** → Captures sequential dependencies in reviews  
- **Dense Layers** → Fully connected layers for classification  
- **Output Layer** → Softmax activation for multi-class sentiment prediction  

**Loss Function** → Categorical Crossentropy  
**Optimizer** → Adam

## 📊 Results  
- Achieved **85–90% accuracy** on the test set  
- Training & validation accuracy/loss plotted for performance monitoring  

**Example Predictions:**  
- “I loved this series!” → **Positive**  
- “It was boring and terrible.” → **Negative**  
- “The show was okay, not too great.” → **Neutral**
